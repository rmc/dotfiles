Config files, my way.

Contains dotfiles (.bash_profile, .gitconfig, .gitignore) and supporting scripts for configuring the bash shell my way.

# Installation

To install the dotfiles [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) is required. You can also download this [ruby script](http://pastie.org/195036) and run it from the dotfiles directory.

Switch to the dotfiles directory and execute the command:

    $ rake install
    
This command will create symbolic links for the dotfiles from this directory to your users home directory.
